		<div>A cross-section through an ocean current. Be aware that the vertical scale has been greatly exaggerated, as a typical current reaches down to about 400 meters, while its width stretches for about 100 kilometers. The closer to the surface of an ocean, the faster a current flows, and the warmer it is.</div>

		<div>Some currents carry warm water, typically from the equatorial parts of the ocean toward the poles, while others move cold water - usually from the polar areas toward the Equator.

 It is difficult to map an ocean current, as the ocean water is clear and the reflection of light on the water surface does not depend on the velocity or temperature of the floating water. One way to map the ocean currents is by using sea surface temperatures derived from satellite imagery, as on these illustrations. Some surface currents carry water with temperature that may significantly vary from nearby water. On the map below, please note the eddies, or rings of warmer surface water created on the sides of the main stream. Similar phenomenon may be observed on the animation on the main side map.</div>

		<div>The rotation of the globe and the force of prevailing winds blowing over the ocean result in the flow of the ocean currents. More specifically, the ocean currents are controlled by three major factors: global winds, the Coriolis force, and the shape of the continents and locations of the major islands. The strongest currents are additionally "powered" by the differences in water temperature and salinity, which both result in the differences of water density, and consequently its weight.</div>

		<div>Ocean currents are giant flowing streams of water that continually move through the ocean in a specific prevailing direction. Some currents flow at the ocean's surface (the upper 400 meters) , while some are found much deeper in the ocean. All ocean currents make a system that circulates around the global ocean. The volume of water transported by the global oceanic Conveyor Belt, (more about it later), is equivalent to the flow of about 100 Amazon Rivers or 16 times the flow of all the world’s rivers combined. This enormous potential of current energy could be utilized. Just think about clean, reliable, and inexhaustible "hydro" energy that is embedded in ocean currents!</div>
